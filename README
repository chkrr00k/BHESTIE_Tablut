Welcome to the README of Behemouth HEuristical STrategic Intelligence Engine (BHESTIE)

To use this fantastic artificial intelligence software I'll show you a small guide for the params it supports:

[white|black]	The color the player will play
	-h 			Yes, i'm telling you this is the command to show the help even if you just did it
	-t <n>		How many thread the program will use (default: 2)
	-f			If the program can't autoscale its depthness (default: false)
	-d <n>		The current max depth (default: 4)
	-s:dw <n>	The times the process have to signaled to be scaled down in depth (default: 0)
	-s:up <n>	The times the process have to signaled to be scaled up in depth (default: 10)
	-H <ip>		The game server host address you want to connect (default: localhost)
	-l <n>		THe max timeout time (default: 60)

The first param MUST be black or white and it decides which player it is going to be!
You can change the timeout by setting the parameter -l.
To change the IP of the server set the -H parameter.
